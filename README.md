# Task4-Classification_with_logistic_regression
This task involves building a binary classifier using logistic regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is Malignant (1) or Benign (0) based on various cell nucleus features.
Steps:
1.Loaded and preprocessed the dataset (diagnosis column converted to binary).
2.Split data into training and testing sets and standardized features.
3.Trained a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn.
4.Evaluated performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
5.Visualized the ROC curve and experimented with threshold tuning.
6.Explained the role of the sigmoid function in logistic regression.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
